### Project 8 Navbar Toggle.

```
In this project I learned how fetch classes of the elements
using classList method which returs list of all the classes present on that element.
Using this we can toggle (add/remove) classNames from an element to give different effects to that particular element.
In this project we hide and unhide the list on the navbar
You can use if else for logic or direct a toggle method which takes
a class as input (which needed to be added on removed on button event.)
